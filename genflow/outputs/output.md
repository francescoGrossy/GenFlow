During the biology lesson, the lecture covered the structure and function of the plasma membrane, emphasizing its role as a dynamic boundary essential for cellular life. The plasma membrane consists primarily of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. The lecture also discussed the fluid mosaic model, which describes the membrane's dynamic and mosaic-like structure. Furthermore, the functions of the plasma membrane were highlighted, including its role in isolation and selective barrier, transport of substances, cellular communication, cell recognition, cell adhesion, and anchorage to the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix. It was emphasized that the plasma membrane is a complex structure that performs various vital functions for the cell's survival and interaction with the external environment.
